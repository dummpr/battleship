# Battleship Game

The application is a partial Battleship game as a web app. The computer has positioned five ships of various sizes on a 10x10 board.

Each round, the player “fires” at a board position of their choice. The computer indicates if this was a “hit” or a “miss”. When all tiles of a particular ship have been hit, the computer indicates that the entire ship has been sunk. When the player has sunk all the ships, the game is over.
